Identification of concrete cracks with the application of deep neural networks.

### Objective:

To be able to identify cracks on images taken for concrete inspection in structures.

### About the data:

The construction of the model and training data is currently being evaluated with a main focused in the following datasets:

[Utah-University](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/all_datasets/48/)

[IEEE](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/elci-edge-based-labeled-crack-image#files)
